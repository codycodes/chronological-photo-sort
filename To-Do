Overall List of things To Do:

*Up to speed on GitHub & Slack?

*Have fun testing & Researching the Face API -> Figure out how to use the Microsoft Face API

(we're testing baby pictures & older pictures) for age

*Discuss how as a team we can implement and then try calling the API (note the 20transactions/minute constraint and 4MB limit!)

*Figure out how to keep track of a single face (facial recognition)

*Discuss the User Interface

*Test some photos :D

* Sort the dictionaries!

* Rename photos with numbers to order them properly on the frontend
